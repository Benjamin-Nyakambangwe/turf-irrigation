      <h1>Waste versus re-circulated drains</h1>
      <img src="./img/1-min.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        Drain design and installation parameters are engineered to ensure drain
        functionality for its intended purpose, allowing for variances in
        volume, matter to be conveyed and maintenance requirements. Drain
        installation takes into account principles related to gravity, vacuum,
        grade, human exposure safety to biological agents and resistance to
        functional failure. also incorporated in drain design are requirements
        for drain maintenance and repair of a blocked drain
      </p>
      <p>
        In some systems the drain is for discharge of waste fluids, such as the
        drain in a sink in which the water is drained when it is no longer
        needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the United Kingdom, plumbers refer to waste water as 'bad water'.
        This is under the premise that the water they are moving from one area
        to another via the use of a drain is not needed and can be removed from
        the area, like a 'bad apple' being removed from a fruit bowl.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other systems, such as fountains or swimming pools where waste fluid
        is recirculated, the drain is the input to the recirculating pumping
        machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the last case, there is an obvious safety issue, because many people
        do not expect to encounter more than the head of water above the drain
        when touching a drain. For example, in a recent case, a lifeguard went
        to the bottom of a pool to retrieve something and his hand got stuck
        because of the extra pressure from the pump. When there is a
        recirculating pump, the risk of suction consists of the head of water,
        plus the suction of the pump (up to a maximum of 1 atmosphere).
      </p>
      <p>
        Fatalities have occurred around drains as a result of this "suction
        entrapment." In these situations, a portion of the body, hair, or
        clothing may become stuck against the drain and may become impossible to
        release, resulting in drowning. Properly designed drains in swimming
        pools and spas mitigate this effect by either adding multiple drains, or
        increasing the surface area of the drain opening, with the use of many
        holes or safety covers. Since drain suction increases rapidly when a
        portion of the drain opening is blocked, having two drains or a larger
        drain inlet allows alternate suction paths for the pump. Swimming pool
        safety devices are available to automatically turn off an operating pump
        if a rapid increase in suction is detected (as could happen during a
        suction entrapment incident).
